# CodeCademy-A-Simple-Car-Loan-Payment-Calculator
In this project, we will write a program that will calculate the monthly car payment a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan.
The program will include the following:
Car loan amount
Interest rate of the loan
Length of the loan (in years)
Down payment
